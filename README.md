# Library-Management-System-MySQL-
Creating a Library Database with MySQL server.
I was given a project to create a database for a library management system, and perform various SQL operations. This project will focus on Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Definition Language (DDL), joins, and subqueries.
The components of the database are:
Books Table:
  Stores  information  about books in the library.
Members Table:
•	It captures essential information about library members.
•	It also facilitates membership tracking, communication, and personalized services.
Borrowed Books Table:
•	It will record books borrowed by providing insights into borrowing patterns.
•	It facilitates tracking of overdue books and the calculation of fines.
Database Setup:
   Create a new database named "LIBRARY_DB" to store the information.
Features
Book Management: Add, update, and remove books from the library's collection. Track book details such as title, category, rental price, availability status, author, and publisher.
Customer Management: Maintain a record of library customers, including their names, addresses, registration dates, and issuance history.
Book Issuance and Returns: Track the issuance and return of books by customers. Monitor the status of issued books and ensure timely returns.
Queries and Analysis
1.	Data retrieval: Get a list of members borrowed a specific authors book.

2.	Query to update the available copies in specified id by1.

3.	Find the most popular genre in the library. Display the genre with the highest total number of books borrowed.
4.	Query  to calculate the overdue books at current date.

5.	Query to find Overdue Books Based on Entered Dates.
6.	Use of DDL COMMAND:  Alter table borrowing with fine.
7.	Find members who return books quickly. Calculate the average duration it takes for each member to return borrowed books and then identify members whose average return time is less than 14 days.

8.	Calculate the average duration in months for which books are borrowed. 

9.	Display the book title and the average duration in months.

10.	Calculate the late fees for each overdue book by multiples of 50.

11.	Find members who borrowed a specific book by book title
12.	Calculate the average duration a book is borrowed by members. Display the book title, the average duration in  days and  them number of times it has been borrowed.

13.	Calculate the average duration a book is borrowed by members. Display the book title, the average duration in days, and the number of times it has been borrowed.
14.	Filter to show only books borrowed less than 5 times.

15.	Find the  most popular genre in the library. Display the  genre with  the highest total number of books borrowed.
16.	Find the top 5 members who have borrowed the most books. Display their names and the number of books they have borrowed.To calculate over due borrowings. Write a query that compares the Return Date with the due date.
17.	Query to add status in borrowing table as default ALTER TABLE Borrowing.
18.	Calculate and add fine in borrowing table.
